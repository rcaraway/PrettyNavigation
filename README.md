# PrettyNavigationBar

An easy way to style your NavigationController and Bars in iOS. 

## How to use

### To easily style all Navigation Bars in the app:
```
UINavigationBar.prettyAppearence(with: .green)
```

### To set if the Navigation bar is large style or not:  
```
UINavigationBar.prettyAppearence(with: .green, large: false)
```

### If you want a `UINavigationController` that is always using a white status bar: 

```
let nav = NavigationController()
```
